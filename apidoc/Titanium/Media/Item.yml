summary: A representation of a media item returned by [openMusicLibrary](Titanium.Media.openMusicLibrary) or [queryMusicLibrary](Titanium.Media.queryMusicLibrary).

    This is a read-only object that describes a single media item, not a playlist. 
    Titanium does not support access to playlists.
    
    `Item` objects cannot be created explicitly.  The 
    [openMusicLibrary](Titanium.Media.openMusicLibrary) returns `Item` objects in its
    `success` callback function, while [queryMusicLibrary](Titanium.Media.queryMusicLibrary)
    returns an array of `Item` objects.
