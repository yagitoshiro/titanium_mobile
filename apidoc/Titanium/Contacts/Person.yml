name: Titanium.Contacts.Person
summary: |
    An object that represents a contact record for a person or organization in the system contacts 
    address book.
description: |
    A person object is created using <Titanium.Contacts.createPerson>.
    
    The following two kinds of properties exist for this object:
    
    * single value - contains either a `string` or `number` type value, an array of `string` type 
    values, or `null` if unset.
    * multi-value - contains a dictionary with typical keys of `home`, `work` and/or `other`. Each 
    key contains either a `string` type value, an array of `string` type values, or a dictionary 
    containing key/value pairs with `string` type values.
    
    #### Adding and Modifying Properties
    
    Support for adding and modifying properties is currently supported on iOS and Android.
    
    #### Keys as Address Book UI Labels
    
    Keys act as labels in the address book user interface.
    
    Although there is limited support for custom, arbitrarily-named, keys when used with multi-value 
    properties, there is no support them with single value properties.
    
    On iOS, creating custom keys is not recommended, and will lead to undefined results.
    
    If a label has been created by the user of the device and used with a multi-value property, it 
    will exist as a key with the same name.
    
    See examples in <Titanium.Contacts> for more information.

        The format of the dictionary accepted by this property is as follows:
        
        * Keys: any of `home`, `work`, and/or `other`.
        * Values: arrays of dictionary types with seven keys, `CountryCode`, `Street`, `City`, 
        `County`, 'State', `Country` and `ZIP`, each with a `string` type value.

        On Android:

        'CountryCode' and 'County' are currently not supported.
        
        On iOS:
        
        The `CountryCode` key value may be one of the recognized two-character ISO 3166-1 country 
        codes, and determines the format in which the contact is presented by the address book 
        user interface. See the wikipedia section 
        [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) 
        for a comprehensive list of codes.
        
        Every new line in the `Street` value may be created using a backslash followed by a letter 
        `n`, for example, `\n`.
