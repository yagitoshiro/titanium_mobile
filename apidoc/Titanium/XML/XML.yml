name: Titanium.XML
summary: The top level XML module.  The XML module is used for parsing and processing XML-based content.
description: |
    The API for this module is based on the W3C DOM specification.
    
    Android and iOS implement the [DOM Level 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html) specification
    with some non-standard extensions, which are documented in the appropriate places.

    Both iOS and Android lack DTD support.

    Mobile Web directly exposes the [DOM Level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html) 
    implementation in the browser. New features introduced in DOM Level 3 are not documented here 
    for brevity. For information on these features, please use the W3C documentation.
