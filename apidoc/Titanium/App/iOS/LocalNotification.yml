    Local notifications are a way for an application that is not running in the foreground to let 
    users know that it has information for them. When invoked, an alert dialog is displayed 
    containing a "Close" button to dismiss or a customizable "View" button to bring the application 
    into the foreground. Also, an application icon badge showing the number of pending notifications 
    may be set and a sound may be generated.
