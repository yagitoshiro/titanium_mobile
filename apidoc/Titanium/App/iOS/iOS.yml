name: Titanium.App.iOS
summary: |
    The top-level App iOS module, available only to iOS devices, that includes the facilities to 
    create and manage local notifications and background services.
description: |
    Local notifications are a way for an application that is not running in the foreground to let 
    users know that it has information for them. When invoked, an alert dialog is displayed 
    containing a "Close" button to dismiss and a customizable "View" button to bring the application 
    into the foreground. Also, they can be configured to set an application icon badge, to show the 
    number of pending notifications, and to generate a sound.
