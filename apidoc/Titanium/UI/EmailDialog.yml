    The Email Dialog is created by <Titanium.UI.createEmailDialog>.
    
    On Mobile Web, the `to` addresses, `cc` addresses, `bcc` addresses, `subject`, and `body` are 
    appended together and formatted into a `mailto:` URL. This URL typically has a limit of 
    approximately 2000 characters.

        send via the Android Gmail or K9 mail clients.
