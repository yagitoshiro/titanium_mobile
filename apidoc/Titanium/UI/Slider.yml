name: Titanium.UI.Slider
summary: A slider component with a draggable thumb.
description: |
    A slider lets the user select from a range of values by dragging the slider thumb. 
    
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createSlider> method to create a slider.
    
    #### Android Platform Implementation Notes

    On Android, the user can also maniuplate the slider using the arrow keys. For this
    reason, placing other focusable UI elements to the left or right of
    the slider is not recommended.

    On Android, both `min` and `max` must be specified for the slider to work properly.

    example: |
        The following sample demonstrates creating a slider and adding a listener to 
        handle the change events.

            var slider = Titanium.UI.createSlider({
                top: 50,
                min: 0,
                max: 100,
                width: '100%',
                value: 50
                });
                
            var label = Ti.UI.createLabel({
                text: slider.value,
                width: '100%',
                height: 'auto',
                top: 30,
                left: 0,
                textAlign: Ti.UI.TEXT_ALIGNMENT_CENTER
                });
            
            slider.addEventListener('change', function(e) {
                label.text = String.format("%3.1f", e.value);
            });

  - name: click
    summary: Fired when the device detects a click against the view.
    description: |
        There is a subtle difference between singletap and click events.

        A singletap event is generated when the user taps the screen briefly
        without moving their finger. This gesture will also generate a click event.

        However, a click event can also be generated when the user touches, 
        moves their finger, and then removes it from the screen.

        For sliders on Android, the click event is **only** generated by a trackball click 
        on the slider thumb.
