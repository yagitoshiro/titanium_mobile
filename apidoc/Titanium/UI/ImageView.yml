name: Titanium.UI.ImageView
summary: |
    A view to display a single image or series of animated images. 
description: |
    
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createImageView> method to create an `ImageView`.
    
    Specifying either a `width` or `height` property for this view will scale its image(s) with 
    the aspect ratio maintained, up to a maximum size that does not exceed its parent view.
    
    #### Android 9-Patch Scaled Images
    
    A nine-patch (9-patch) image is simply a standard `png` image with a transparent border of a 
    single pixel, containing "guides" defined by solid black (`#000`) color fills. Guides added to the 
    top and left edges determine that the image may be stretched in horizontal and vertical planes 
    respectively. Optionally, the content area may be defined by guides added to the bottom and 
    right edges.
    
    Although any image editor may be used to create the guides, certain settings can cause the edges 
    of the graphic to "bleed" into the transparent border, consequently making it non-transparent. 
    Thus, the `draw9patch` utility provided in the Android SDK tools directory is recommended for 
    this purpose.
    
    For further information about nine-patch images and the Android utility, see the 
    [Nine-patch](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/2d-graphics.html#nine-patch) 
    and [Draw 9-patch](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/draw9patch.html) sections 
    of the Android Developer website.
    
    The nine-patch technique may be used with any of Titanium's static image properties. See the 
    "Button with Nine-patch Background Image" example for a demonstration.

examples:
  - title: Basic Image View
    example: |
        In this example, we create a simple image view:
        
            Ti.UI.backgroundColor = 'white';
            var win = Ti.UI.createWindow();
            var image = Ti.UI.createImageView({
              image:'/images/myimage.png'
            });
            win.add(image);
            win.open();
  - title: Button with Nine-patch Background Image
    example: |
        To prepare, copy the images 
        [custom-slider-right.9.png](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/raw/master/demos/KitchenSink/Resources/images/custom-slider-right.9.png) 
        and [custom-slider-left.9.png](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/raw/master/demos/KitchenSink/Resources/images/custom-slider-left.9.png) 
        into the project `/images/` directory/.
        
        Create a button with a nine-patch image background, that swaps with another image when 
        selected, and generates a message in the console when clicked.
        
        Note that images are referenced in the code without the `.9` part of the filename, and that 
        the project should be cleaned to ensure that the files are correctly copied to the project.
        
            var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
                backgroundColor: 'white',
                exitOnClose: true,
                fullscreen: false,
                title: 'Click button to test'
            });
             
            var button = Ti.UI.createButton({
                backgroundImage: '/images/custom-slider-right.png',
                backgroundSelectedImage:'/images/custom-slider-left.png',
                title: 'Click me!',
                top: 10,
                width: 300,
                height: 200
            });
            button.addEventListener('click',function(e){
                Ti.API.info("You clicked the button");
            });
            win.add(button);
            win.open();
