name: Titanium.UI.ScrollView
summary: |
    A view that contains a horizontally and/or vertically-scrollable region of content.  
description: |
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createScrollView> method to create a scroll view.
    
    Views added to the scroll view will be scrolled based on the size of the scrollable region of 
    content. If a scrollable region fits within the size of its scroll view, the view will not 
    scroll.
    
    #### Android
    
    On Android, a scroll view can only scroll in one direction, either vertical or horizontal, 
    and not both at the same time. Hence, the <Titanium.UI.ScrollView.scrollType> property may be 
    used to set the scroll direction explicitly.
    
    If the `scrollType` property is not defined, the scroll view attempts to deduce the scroll 
    direction based on some of the other properties that have been set. Specifically, if 
    `contentWidth` and `width` are both set and are equal to each other, or if they are both set 
    *and* `showVerticalScrollIndicator` is set to `true`, then the scroll direction is set to 
    "vertical".  If `contentHeight` and `height` are both set and are equal, or if they are both 
    set and `showHorizontalScrollIndicator` is set to `true`, then the scroll direction is set 
    to "horizontal".  If `scrollType` is set, it overrides the deduced setting.

    platforms: [iphone, ipad, mobileweb]
    parameters:
      - name: contentOffset
        summary: |
            X and Y coordinates to which to reposition the top-left point of the scrollable region.

  - name: setZoomScale
    summary: Sets the value of the [zoomScale](Titanium.UI.ScrollView.zoomScale) property.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    parameters:
      - name: zoomScale
        summary: Scaling factor of the scroll view's content.
        type: Number
        
      - name: animated

        type: zoomScaleOption
        optional: true
        
  - name: scrollToBottom
    summary: Moves the end of the scrollable region into the viewable area.
    description: |
        On Android the behavior of `scrollToBottom` depends on whether this scroll view scrolls 
        horizontally or vertically. For vertical scroll views, `scrollToBottom` moves the bottom 
        of the scrollable region into the viewable area. For horizontal scroll views,
        `scrollToBottom` moves the rightmost edge of of the scrollable region into the viewable area.
        
        On iOS, `scrollToBottom` moves the bottom-right corner of the scrollable region into the 
        viewable area.
