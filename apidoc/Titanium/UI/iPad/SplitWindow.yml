name: Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow
summary: |
    A SplitWindow is a window that manages the presentation of two side-by-side view 
    controllers. 
description: |
    You use this class to implement a master-detail interface, in which the left-side view presents 
    a list of items and the right-side presents details of the selected item. The SplitView is for 
    use exclusively on iPad devices. 
    
    By default, the SplitView shows both master and detail views in landscape orientation. When the 
    device switches into portrait orientation, the detail view occupies the entire screen. The user 
    can click a button to bring up the master view as floating, "popover" view. (To show the master 
    view in both orientations, set `showMasterInPortrait` to `true`.) 
    
    Use the <Titanium.UI.iPad.createSplitWindow> method to create a SplitWindow. The `masterView` 
    and `detailView` properties are required in the constructor of the SplitWindow and cannot be 
    changed once set. 
    
    The SplitWindow inherits its methods and properties from <Titanium.UI.Window>. 
    
    The SplitWindow is a top-level window and cannot be contained within another window or view.
