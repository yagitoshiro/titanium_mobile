name: Titanium.UI.OptionDialog
summary: |
    An option dialog is a modal view that includes a message and one or more option items positioned 
    in the middle of the display on Android and at the bottom edge on iOS. On Android, buttons may 
    be added below the options.
description: |
    An option dialog is created using <Titanium.UI.createOptionDialog>.
    
    This dialog is considerably different on each platform, as described below.
    
    #### Android
    
    On Android, this dialog is shown in the middle of the display (not touching the edges), 
    with the option items represented in a picker. The previously-selected, or default, item can be 
    set on creation.
    
    Buttons below the picker may be optionally defined. The `click` event returns a Boolean value 
    to indicate whether either an option item or a button was clicked.
    
    #### iOS
    
    The `destructive` property may be set for an item, to give a visual cue that selecting it 
    results in an irreversible action.
    
    On iOS 4, option dialogs are automatically cancelled when the application is paused/suspended.
    
    ##### iPhone
    
    On iPhone, this dialog is shown at the bottom edge of the display, with the option items 
    represented as vertical buttons. 
    
    ##### iPad
    
    On iPad, this dialog is shown in the middle of the display, or as a popover-like dialog if 
    another view or control is specified via an argument.

    Note that on iPad, the cancel button is not displayed -- users can cancel the dialog
    by clicking outside of the dialog.
    
    #### Caveats
    
    Care should be taken not to define any properties that are not documented, as this may produce 
    unexpected results. For example, setting a `message` property will prevent the picker of option 
    items from being displayed on Android.

events:
  - name: click
    summary: |
        Fired when an option of this dialog is clicked or, under certain circumstances, when this 
        dialog is dismissed.
    description: |
        On iOS as of 1.9, when the dialog is dismissed without using an option, for example, using 
        the [hide](Titanium.UI.OptionDialog.hide) method (iPhone, iPad) or a tap outside of the 
        dialog (iPad), this event is fired as though the cancel option was selected. In these 
        circumstances, the `index` property will be the cancel option index if defined or `-1` 
        otherwise.
    properties:
      - name: index
        summary: |
            Index of the option that was pressed. See description for result of the dialog being 
            dismissed in some other way.

      - name: cancel
        summary: |

            On Android, indicates whether the cancel button was clicked, in which 
            case returns `true`. 
            
            On iOS and Mobile Web, the value of the [cancel](Titanium.UI.OptionDialog.cancel) 
            property is returned, if defined, or `-1` otherwise. 
        type: [Boolean, Number]

    summary: Index to define the cancel option.
    description: |
        On iOS, set to `-1` to disable the cancel option.
        
        On iPad, the `cancel` option must be set to either `-1` or the index of the last 
        option. For example, if there are 3 options and one of them is a cancel button,
        the cancel button must be the last option (index 2).  If `cancel` is set to a 
        different value, _the last entry in the [options](Titanium.UI.OptionDialog.options) 
        array **is not displayed**._

        Note that the cancel button is never shown on iPad, since the user can cancel the 
        dialog by clicking outside of the dialog.
