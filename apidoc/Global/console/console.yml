name: Global.console
summary: Console logging facilities.
description: |
    The toplevel `console` support is intended to supplement <Titanium.API>
    and make it easier for developers to port existing javascript code
    (especially CommonJS modules) to Titanium.
    
    Note that `console` does not currently implement the complete
    [firebug specification](http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API).
    Our support is roughly equivalent to that offered by
    [node.js's console](http://nodejs.org/api/stdio.html).
since: "2.1.0"
methods:
  - name: log
    summary: Log a message at the `info` level.
    description: |
        The message to log can either be a single argument, or any number
        of arguments, which will be converted to strings and then concatenated
        together with a space character.
        
        Note that this method has different behavior from <Titanium.API.log>,
        which can take multiple arguments, but in doing so interprets the
        first argument as a custom log level.

      - name: message
        summary: The message(s) to log.
        type: Object

  - name: info
    summary: Log a message at the `info` level.
